# Elevia Group Platform

A sophisticated financial intelligence platform demonstrating the technical capabilities required for building a modern Operating System for investment management. This platform showcases the core backend architecture, data integration expertise, and quantitative logic implementation needed to make businesses boardroom-ready, ensuring they are structurally sound, capital-ready, and built for long-term success.

## Platform Architecture

This multi-tenant SaaS platform demonstrates the foundational technology stack for productising proven financial methodologies:

### Multi-Tenant SaaS Architecture

- **Scalable Backend**: Python FastAPI with async processing for high-concurrency client workloads
- **Database Design**: PostgreSQL architecture optimised for complex financial datasets with multi-tenant data isolation
- **API Integration**: Robust integrations to diverse financial data sources including Bloomberg and Refinitiv simulation
- **Quantitative Processing**: Implementation of quantitative models for data reconciliation, transaction validation, and performance attribution

### Financial Data Pipeline

- **Data Aggregation**: Multi-source data normalisation from custodians, market data providers, and Excel-based reporting
- **Portfolio Reconciliation**: Intricate reconciliation workflows demonstrating fund administration capabilities
- **Transaction Validation**: Automated validation pipelines for trade settlement and operational workflows
- **Investor Reporting**: Core operational infrastructure for accurate accounting and compliance reporting

## Key Capabilities Demonstrated

### **Real-Time Market Data Integration**

- **Bloomberg Integration**: Live market regime detection, volatility clustering, and sector performance analysis
- **Custodial Data Processing**: Simulated custodian data aggregation and normalisation workflows
- **Performance Attribution**: Revenue growth analysis, EBITDA projections, and risk metric calculations (Sharpe ratios, maximum drawdown)

### **Quantitative Modelling**

- **Scenario Analysis**: Bull/Base/Bear case modelling with Monte Carlo simulations for investment decision support
- **Financial Forecasting**: Dynamic model recalculation based on market conditions and client assumptions
- **Risk Analytics**: Comprehensive risk assessment including volatility analysis and credit spread monitoring

### **Operational Workflows**

- **Due Diligence Management**: Transaction lifecycle tracking with document management and workflow automation
- **Compliance Reporting**: Automated generation of board decks, investor updates, and regulatory filings
- **Data Quality Monitoring**: Real-time assessment of data completeness, accuracy, and timeliness across sources

### **Multi-Tenant Infrastructure**

- **Client Isolation**: Database schema designed for secure multi-tenant data partitioning
- **Scalable Processing**: Microservice architecture enabling independent scaling per client workload
- **Configurable Workflows**: Flexible operational pipelines adaptable to bespoke client requirements

## Production Infrastructure

### Current Demonstration Environment

The platform runs on DigitalOcean infrastructure demonstrating cloud-native deployment patterns directly transferable to AWS production environments:

- **Containerised Deployment**: Docker-based Python backend with PostgreSQL cluster
- **Cloud Database Management**: Managed database with optimised connection pooling and performance monitoring
- **API Gateway Architecture**: FastAPI serving multiple microservice endpoints with health monitoring
- **VPC Networking**: Secure networking configuration with firewall rules and load balancing

### Enterprise Scalability

The architectural decisions demonstrate enterprise-ready patterns:

- **AWS Migration Path**: Direct translation to EC2/ECS, RDS, ALB, and CloudWatch
- **Kubernetes Ready**: Container orchestration for horizontal scaling and high availability
- **Multi-Tenant Security**: Database design supporting client data isolation and compliance requirements

## Data Flow Architecture

The platform demonstrates sophisticated data processing pipelines with real-time market integration:
